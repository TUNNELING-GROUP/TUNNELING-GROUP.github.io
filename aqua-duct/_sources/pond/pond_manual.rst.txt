*Pond* manual
==============

*Pond* application is a driver that uses :mod:`aquaduct` module to perform further analysis of results from *Valve* calculations.

*Pond* can calculate pockets present in the protein and free energy profiles of :ref:`master_paths_manual`.


*Pond* invocation
------------------

Once :mod:`aquaduct` module is installed (see :doc:`../aquaduct_install`) properly on the machine, *Pond* is available as ``pond.py`` command line tool.

Options common with *Valve*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All options related to Molecular Dynamic simulation data, configuration file, and threads have the same meaning as in *Valve*.

For detailed explanation of the following options see :doc:`../valve/valve_manual`:

* ``-c CONFIG_FILE`` - Configuration file name. *Pond* and *Valve* should use the same file.
* ``-t THREADS`` - Limits Aqua-Duct calculations to given number of threads.
* ``--debug`` and ``--debug-file`` - Allows to get debugging information.

Results directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Pond* produces many results files, especially if windows options are used. For the sake of convenience,
option ``-r`` allows to provide output directory.
If provided directory does not exist it will be created without warning.
Also, *Pond* will not warn if results files overwrites existing files.

*Pond* calculations options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other options are used to start or adjust *Pond* calculations:

* **Pockets**
    Option ``--pockets`` triggers pocket calculations
* **Hot-spots**
    Option ``--hotspots`` triggers hot-spot calculations but it also requires ``--pockets``.
* **Energy profiles**
    Option ``--energy-profile`` triggers free energy profiles calculations for master paths.

*Pond*'s option ``--paths-types`` allows to limit calculations only to paths of certain molecules. For example, ``--paths-types 'WAT OXY'`` loads paths of ``WAT`` (water molecules) and ``OXY`` (oxygen) molecules. All other paths (if any) will not be used.

Free energy estimation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Pond* can estimate free energy by using calculated density of traced molecules.
It becomes particularly useful and relevant when traced molecules include solvent.

Estimation of free energy is done according to Boltzmann inversion. Similar method
was used in `Rao,S. et al. <https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2017.1306163>`_
(doi:10.1080/19336950.2017.1306163) paper.

Following equation relates free energy with density of molecules:

.. math::

    n(z) = C \cdot e^{\left( \frac {-E(z) }{ kT} \right) }

Where *z* is point in the space, preferably along some kind of path, *n(z)* is density of molecules
in point *z*, *C* is a normalization constant, *E* is free energy, *k* is Boltzmann's constant,
and *T* is temperature.

One can easily transform the above equation to calculate energy:

.. math::

    E(z) = -kT\ln\left(n(z)\right) -kT\ln\left(C\right)

Term :math:`kT\ln\left(C\right)` does not depend on *z* and can be determined by assumption that
free energy in the bulk of traced molecules (solvent) is zero.

Please note that option ``--temperature`` allows to set desired temperature in Kelvins.

.. note::

    *Pond* returns energy in kJ/mol SI units.

Bulk reference
##############

Value of reference correction can be directly passed to *Pond* using ``--reference-value`` option or can be calculated automatically by analysis of the bulk of traced molecules (solvent) using ``--reference-calc`` flag. Following additional options influence calculation of bulk reference:

#. Radius of the bulk around COG.
    Option ``--reference-radius`` allows to set the radius of the sphere within which the bulk will be
    scanned. The sphere is centered in COG. Radius should be selected in such a way that the sphere
    does not overlaps with other molecules in the simulated system. Default value is 2.0 Å.
#. Density of reference molecules.
    Once COG if the bulk and radius are setup, *Pond* scans trajectory and looks for molecules.
    Option ``--reference-mol`` allows to define molecules for which density should be calculated.

.. note::

    If no ``--reference-value``  or ``--reference-calc`` options are used *Pond* skips estimation of free energy.

Raw data
^^^^^^^^

Two types of data can by used by *Pond*:

#. Separate paths (including passing paths if any), or
#. Raw paths saved at stage II.

By default separate paths are used. Option ``--raw`` makes *Pond* to use raw paths in all calculations,
whereas ``--raw-master`` makes *Pond* to use raw paths only in estimation of free energy profiles and
for pockets and hot-spots separate paths are used.

.. note::

    Best results of pockets calculation can be achieved with separate paths.

.. warning::

    Free energy estimation with separate paths may very likely lead to false results at the borders
    of the scope.

Windows
^^^^^^^

*Pond* performs calculations for entire trajectory and/or for user defined windows:

* ``--window-full`` ensures that results will be calculated for the entire trajectory.
* ``--windows`` allows to set number of windows.
* ``--wsize`` allows to change default size of windows.

By default, windows' sizes are automatically set in such a way that entire trajectory is
covered and windows do not overlap to each other. Option ``--wsize`` allows to set size of
windows (in frames), therefore, windows can also overlap with each other or can span only
selected sections of the trajectory.

For example, for 25 000 snapshots long trajectory one can perform calculations in 5000 frames
long windows where an overlap of a consecutive window with a next window is 4000 frames long - see following picture:

.. aafig::
    :aspect: 1
    :scale: 100
    :proportional:
    :textual:
    :foreground: #000


    "0"      "5000"    "10 000"                      "25 000 frames"
    -------------------------------------------------->
    <-------->      "Window 1, frames    0-4999"
      <-------->    "Window 2, frames  999-5999"
        <-------->  "Window 3, frames 1999-6999"
    ^^^      ^      "etc..."
    |||      |
    ||+------+"4000 frames overlap"
    ++
      "1000 frames shift"


To calculate proper number of windows evenly spanning trajectory one can use following equation:

.. math::

    WINDOWS = \frac{TOTAL - WSIZE}{SHIFT} + 1

Where *WINDOWS* is a desired number of windows, *TOTAL* is total length of trajectory, and *SHIFT* is *WSIZE - OVERLAP*.

In the above example *TOTAL* = 25 000, *WSIZE* = 5 000, *SHIFT* = *WSIZE* - *OVERLAP* = 5 000 - 4 000 = 1 000. Therefore:

.. math::

    WINDOWS = \frac{25 000 - 5000}{1 000} + 1 = 21.

And *Pond* should be called with ``--windows 21 --wsize 5000`` options to get above described windows.

Pockets
-------

Pockets are calculated by analysis of paths found by *Valve*. A regular grid is constructed
spanning all paths. Grid size by default is 1 Å and can be altered with ``--gsize`` option.

.. note::

    As for now, it is recommended that multiplicative inverse of grid size is an integer number.
    Therefore, grid size can be safely set to 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1 etc.

Next, number of paths crossing each of the grid cells is calculated over the entire trajectory and
divided by the number of frames. This gives averaged density of traced molecules.

Cells with null density are removed from the grid and resulted shape corresponds to maximal area
penetrated by traced molecules.

.. note::

    If no estimation of free energy is performed values returned for pockets and hot-spots
    are density (of traced molecules).

.. warning::

    Estimation of free energy for pockets calculated for non raw data may be unreliable.

Inner & outer pocket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distribution of densities in the grid has positive skew. This suggest that pocket can be partitioned
into areas of different overall distribution of traced molecules.

Indeed, *Pond* saves two types of pockets depending on the distribution of densities in the grid:

#. **Inner pocket**
    This is part of the pocket for which densities are greater than mean value.
#. **Outer pocket**
    This is counter part for **Inner pocket**, i.e. the part of the pocket for which densities are less than mean value.

Hot-spots
^^^^^^^^^

Further analysis of distribution of densities in the grid allows to select points of the highest densities.
They are considered as **hot-spots**, i.e. points of particular importance at which traced molecules
are attracted or trapped and stays for considerably long time.

Currently **hot-spots** are detected as far right tail of the distribution of densities in the grid.

Energy profiles
---------------

*Pond* estimates energy profiles of master paths.
For each point of the master path density of paths of traced molecules is calculated within
sphere of radius set by ``--master-radius`` option.

Option ``--master-ctypes`` allows to select master paths *ctypes* for which free energy estimation is
calculated.
